NOTE: This is a placeholder page for my hobbies, it is incomplete as of 2022-10-05.

Not everything in life is work, our passions are as important to how we define ourselves (or even more so).

Here you can see some of my hobbies and how I relate to them.
Some of these have their own pages with pictures and/or more descriptions.

* English
