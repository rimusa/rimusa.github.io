Here you can find some of the projects I have been involved in, along with a small description.
Some of them also have a link to their own page.


## [Reduce Soluciones](./reduce)

Reduce is a startup founded by me and my family in 2016. 
We are devoted to bringing renewable energy solutions to people in the central region of Mexico at an affordable price.

## Hackathons

Here you can find a list of the hackathons I have participated in.

- **Code Against Hate (September 2020; Online)**<br>
The idea was to propose a solution to help curb online hate speech without incurring in censorship.
My team got first place by proposing hate.no, a grammarly-like plugin/API for messaging services.
It would alert the user if the message they are about to post could be considered abusive.
This allows the user to either change their message or to post it as-is.
The idea is "think twice before you post".
You can find the presentation [here](https://fb.watch/2_RKIGY0pA/).

- **Hello World 2022 (February 2020; Edinburgh, Scotland)**<br>
My team was the runner-up in the Quantum Black challenge of the hackathon.
The idea was to use the kedro python package to propose an ML solution.
We designed a model to predict whether an epidemic risks becoming a pandemic given flight information of the affected areas.
