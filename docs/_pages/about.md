Hi! I am Ricardo Muñoz Sánchez and I come from Mexico City, Mexico.
I am currently doing a PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Gothenburg.
My project is on bias and fairness on automatic second language evaluation.

Other of my professional interests are the ethics AI, hatespeech detection, fake news detection, and rumor mining.

I did an undergraduate degree in Mathematics at UNAM (in Mexico) and a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Edinburgh.
