Not everything in life is work, our passions are as important to how we define ourselves (or even more so).
Here you can see some of my hobbies and how I relate to them.

I have made posts for some of these, feel free to check them out!

- **[Photography](./photos)**  
Taking pictures is one of my passions, I think it's one way to capture the world around us and to add a bit of ourselves to how it is depicted.
From ominous clouds hovering over grand landscapes to treasured moments of familiarity and peace.
From individual odysseys into the unknown to fleeting but valuable moments spent with friends.
In the end, what we portray in photos tells as much about the other as it does about ourselves.

- **Cooking**  
Food has always been a way to connect with others and with our culture.
I love cooking and experimenting with new kinds of cuisine, as well as making dishes that I enjoy.
Sharing food is an important part of life and a way to show affection towards others.

- **Miniature Painting**  
I used to play games such as Magic: The Gathering some time ago.
The strategy is fun and it presents interesting challenges.
The sad part is that once you're done playing, everything goes back to the box and stays there.
I decided to start painting Warhammer miniatures because I thought it would be a fun hobby where I could have something to show both to others and to myself.
I've never actually gotten around to playing, though.

- **Language Learning**  
In addition to working with languages, I also enjoy learning new ones.
    - The languages I can communicate in (so far) are the following:
        - Spanish (my mother tongue)
        - English
        - Swedish (basic communication)
        - French (basic communication)
    - Other languages I've tried to learn in the past (and will get back to eventually):
        - Arabic
        - Japanese
