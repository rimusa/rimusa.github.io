### PhD in Natural Language Processing

I am currently doing a PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Gothenburg, more specifically at Språkbanken Text. You can find their website [here](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/). I started in October 2021 and expect to finish sometime in late 2025 or early 2026.

My project is on bias and fairness of automatic second language evaluation.
My advisor is [Elena Volodina](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en/about/staff/elena).
I have previously worked on fake news detection with [Peter Ljunglöf](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peb/) and [Dimitrios Kokkinakis](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en/about/staff/dimitrios).

I have taken courses on:

- Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing
- Research Ethics in the Humanities
- Argumentation Mining
- Academic Communication

For my teaching experience as part of this program, you can see the [work experience](./work) section of my website.

### MSc in Artificial Intelligence (2020)

I studied my masters at the University of Edinburgh from September 2019 to August 2020.

My dissertation project was on how altering bias in word embeddings affects the fairness of hate speech classification of Spanish tweets. My advisors were [Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant](https://seraphinatarrant.github.io/) and [Adam Lopez](http://alopez.github.io/) You can find the repo for the project [here](https://github.com/rimusa/embedding_bias), the project proposal [here](https://github.com/rimusa/embedding_bias/blob/master/documents/MSc_Dissertation.pdf), and the dissertation [here](https://github.com/rimusa/embedding_bias/blob/master/documents/MSc_Dissertation.pdf).

Some of the courses that I took include:

- Accelerated Natural Language Processing (ANLP)
- Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (MLPR)
- Machine Learning Practical (MLP)
- Natural Language Understanding, Generation, and Machine Translation (NLU+)
- Computational Cognitive Neuroscience (CNN)
- Algorithmic Game Theory and Applications (AGTA)
- Informatics Project Proposal (IPP)
- Informatics Research Review (IRR)

Other projects I participated in were:

- A comparison of multimodal emotion recognition models using the [MELD dataset](https://affective-meld.github.io/). Some of the architectures we used included LSTMs and gated attention models.
- A survey of the current state (as of January, 2020) of computational linguistics regarding Ancient Egyptian. The paper for this project can be found [here](../documents/IRR_Final.pdf).
- A project where we compared and visualized different sparse word representation similarity metrics. The repo for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/rimusa/ANLP_Assignment_2).


### BSc in Mathematics (2018)

I studied my undergrad at the UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) from August 2012 to September 2018.

My dissertation was on the order types of maximal chains of subgraphs of the random graph that are isomorphic to it. My advisor was [David Meza Alcántara](http://lancelot.fciencias.unam.mx/index.php/nosotros/profesores-de-tiempo-completo/278-dr-meza-alcantara-david). The dissertation can be accessed from [here](http://132.248.9.195/ptd2018/septiembre/0780018/Index.html) and is based on several papers by Milŏs  Kurilíc.

	- Higher Algebra
	- Linear Algebra
	- Modern Algebra
- Calculus and Analysis:
	- Differential and Integral Calculus
	- Differential Equations
	- Partial Differential Equations
