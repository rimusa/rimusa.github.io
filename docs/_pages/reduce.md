## Reduce

Reduce Soluciones is a startup founded in 2016 by me and my family. The idea is to bring renewable energy solutions to homes and small businesses in the central region of Mexico.

We focus mostly on providing solutions related to electrical energy, natural gas usage, and water usage.
Some of the more common projects we've implemented for these include (but are not limited to): photovoltaic energy (i.e. solar panels), solar thermal systems, and rainwater harvesting.

We also provide courses, both on the technologies we use and implement and well as more general talks on sustainablity.

You can access our website [here](https://reducesoluciones.com/) and our Facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/reducesoluciones), both in Spanish.
