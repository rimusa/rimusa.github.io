So I recently decided to move all the documents and images from the repos for this website over to Gist.
This makes it a bit harder for people to rip all of my pictures and documents straight from here.
It might have broken some links, though.
If you notice any, please tell me.
If you were linking to anything in my website and this update broke links on your side, reach out to me and I can send you the updated links.
